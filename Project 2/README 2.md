# 🚀 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning 🔍

## 📝 Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates diabetes prediction using machine learning techniques. The notebook covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## 🌟 Features
- ✅ Data preprocessing and cleaning
- 📊 Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- 🛠️ Feature selection and engineering
- 🤖 Model training using supervised learning algorithms
- 📉 Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- 🔍 Prediction and classification of diabetes cases

## ⚙️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd diabetes-prediction
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🚀 Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Run the `Diabetics Prediction.ipynb` notebook step by step.

## 📦 Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
- 🐼 pandas
- 🔢 numpy
- 🤖 scikit-learn
- 📊 matplotlib
- 🎨 seaborn
- 📝 Jupyter Notebook

You can install them using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used for diabetes prediction should be placed in the `data/` directory. Ensure the dataset is properly formatted before running the notebook.

## 📊 Model Evaluation
The trained models are evaluated using:
