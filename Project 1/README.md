# 🚀 Fraud Detection using Machine Learning 🔍

## 📝 Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates fraud detection using machine learning techniques. The notebook covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## 🌟 Features
- ✅ Data preprocessing and cleaning
- 📊 Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- 🛠️ Feature selection and engineering
- 🤖 Model training using supervised learning algorithms
- 📉 Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- 🔍 Prediction and fraud classification

## ⚙️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fraud-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd fraud-detection
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🚀 Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Run the `Fraud Detection.ipynb` notebook step by step.

## 📦 Dependencies
